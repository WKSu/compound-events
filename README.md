# Social Consequences of Past Compound Events

The aftermath of compound events will be analyzed with the help of Agent Based Modeling to gain a better understanding of the social consequences. 

One example of such a phenomena is the [Laacher See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laacher_See) eruption approximately 13,000 years ago located in present-day Germany. Archaeologist Felix Riede believes that this event has caused technological regression. The new inhabitants after the eruption were not as advanced in their toolmaking, even with some losing bow and arrow technology. 

This project was made with love by Brennen Bouwmeester and Kevin Su with supervision from Felix Riede.
